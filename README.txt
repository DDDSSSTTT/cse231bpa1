Q1:
1.pow(2,-1)
In python, it equals 0.5, in this PA, it equals 0. 
To make pow accurate, we must support floating numbers.
2.print(3)
In python, it prints 3, in this PA, it prints "3\n3".
We should make the element of print only be added to the output once.
3.
x=1
x
In python, these sentences prints nothing, in this PA, the webpage prints 1.
To fix this, we need functions to decide whether to output the top of the stack machine.
Q2:
I find the tutorial video made by the TA most helpful. 
Yet 2-hours time length almost scares me away, maybe several pieces of shorter videos(15-20min) can be more user-friendly.
Q3:
I finish this project by myself. I saw the notification of collaboration only after I finish testing the code. Hence no one else is involved.
